### Randomize Elderbug Rewards
In Lore Master Extra, the player can follow a questline with Elderbug, which gives various rewards for certain milestones. These will be randomized.

If this setting is not randomized, Elderbug will grant the Lore page with control automatically once you talked to him.

#### Interaction
- Elderbug is NOT affected by Cursed Listening (as well as the snail shaman for Vengeful Spirit, due to the original questline)

### Randomize Traveller
Randomizes the four traveller NPCs Quirrel, Cloth, Tiso and Zote.
- Quirrel at Black Egg temple

Traveller Order determines how the NPC should appear:
- Vanilla: NPC appear in the exact order as you can see above.
- Randomized: Randomizes the order in which the NPC actually travel. Doesn't change the last location.
- Everywhere: You can always find the NPC at all their locations (as long as they have items left)

Regardless of the settings, the spawn will always be determined by this Mod and not the Vanilla requirement. As an example, 
Tiso would normally only appear in Dirtmouth once you obtained Mothwing Cloak. With this mod he would be there regardless 
if you actually have dash or not (as long as the stage is high enough).

#### Interaction
- If Cursed Listening is active, you'll be prevent from talking to them, until you find the ability.

### Randomize Treasure
Randomizes the 14 buried treasures across Hallownest. If not randomized, you can buy the maps from Iselda after obtaining "Lemm's Order".
Treasure Grounds are only available once you obtained the corresponding map and require dive to gain the items. Using this setting,
will always immediatly grant you the Ability "Treasure Hunter", which allows you to sell relics for more geo, once you found the special ones.
Shuffles the Master key, which opens most doors in the game and is considered in logic for keys.
Also add a medallion which increases the chance of obtaining essence from enemies drastically.

### Force Compass for Treasure
If on, every treasure ground is only considered in logic, once you got Wayward Compass. Entering a room with a treasure location while having Compass equipped,
will notify you that there's a treasure in this room and display what the item there is. This setting is recommended for the first time, you play with treasures.

### Randomize Treasure Charts
Randomizes the 14 treasure charts, Lemms Door and Iselda's second shop. With "Lemm's Order" (an item) you have access to more items in Iselda's shop 
(like with Sly's Key).

Treasure Charts and Treasure will be added to vanilla regardless of your settings!

#### Cursed Listening
- Randomizes the ability to talk to NPC.

#### Cursed Reading
- Randomizes the ability to read lore tablets.

#### Black Egg Temple Condition
Determines what is need for opening the black egg temple.
- Dreamers: Like Vanilla the door opens once you have 3 dreamers.
- Lore: The door opens once you obtained enough lore bits.
- Both: Self explaining.
As Lore count the 33 Vanilla Lore Tablets as well as:
- The NPCs
- The dream dialogues
- The point of interest
- The dream warrior statues
IF they are either randomized OR if Refs are defined.

#### Power Behaviour
Determines how the abilities of the mod should behave.
- Default: All powers will be set to their default state (mostly local)
- Only Recommended Ones: Remove all abilities besides a few ones that help you with exploration:
  - Tourist: Creates a portal between City Fountain and Black egg temple
  - Requiem: Upon death, holding focus will let you return to Dirtmouth, holding C-Dash (if obtained) will bring you to Hallownest's Crown. Holding dreamnail 
    (if obtained) will port you to Spirit's glade (if the door is open). Useless in Steel Soul
  - Stag Adoption: You can take the egg in Stag nest to spawn a portable one time stag from everywhere. Requires Lore Page Access. The egg respawns 5 minutes after
    being used.
  - Treasure Hunter: Explained under Randomize Treasure
  - Grass Bombardement: Pressing left and cast will spawn a bomb which will explode after 3 second, dealing damage AND breaking damage ground. (An extra dive basically)
    Pressing right and cast while having lifeblood will remove one and destroy EVERY breakable wall and ground. EVEN ONE WAY WALLS.
  - Greater Mind: The tracker for lore.
- Only Tracker: Only the tracker will function.
- Remove All: Remove all abilities making it as vanilla as possible.
- Custom: Allows you define the tags yourself. Note: The states of individual powers will NOT affect the hash!

## Other Mods

### Rando Plus
- Mr. Mushroom and the Nailsmith are affected by Cursed Listening.

### Real Journal Rando
- Colo 3 and the shade statue in Hall of Gods are affected by Cursed Reading.
- LoreMaster increases the chance to see Menderbug drastically, making randomized Menderbug way less tedious. Also this mod prevents Menderbug from fleeing and the
  player from killing them. You will be granted the items, once you hit them with your nail.
  
### More Doors
- The "Master Key" isn't able to open the doors placed by this mod. Instead it will show you where the key is (currently unimplemented)
